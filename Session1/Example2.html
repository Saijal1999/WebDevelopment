<h2><b>Early life</b></h2>
<h3>Childhood and Family</h3>
<p3><div>
    Elon Reeve <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> was born on <u>June 28, 1971</u>, in Pretoria, one of 
    the capital cities of apartheid South Africa.[8][9] His mother
    is Maye <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> (nÃ©e Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, 
    Canada, but raised in South Africa.[10][11][12] His father is Errol <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span>, 
    a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and
    property developer who was a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake 
    Tanganyika.[13][14] <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a 
    younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[12][15] His maternal grandfather, 
    Joshua Haldeman, was an adventurous American-born Canadian who took his 
    family on record-breaking journeys in a single-engine Bellanca airplane to
    Africa and Australia.[16][17][18] <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> has British and Pennsylvania Dutch
    ancestry.[19][20] He was baptized into the Anglican Church.
</div>
</p3>
<br>
<p4><div>
    <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span>'s family was wealthy during his youth. His father was elected to the 
    Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive 
    Party, with the <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> children reportedly sharing their father's dislike of 
    apartheid.[8] After his parents divorced in <u>1980</u>, <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> mostly lived with his
     father,[19] a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently 
     regretted.[23] <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> has become estranged from his father.[23] He has a paternal 
     half-sister and a half-brother.
</div>
</p4>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p5><div>
    Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,[31] <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span>
     applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.[32][33] 
     While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria for
      five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in the South African
       military.[34] <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second
        cousin in Saskatchewan for a year,[35] working odd jobs at a farm and 
        lumber-mill.[36] In <u>1990</u>, he entered Queen's University in Kingston,
         Ontario.[37][38] Two years later, he transferred to the University of 
         Pennsylvania, where he completed studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree in
          physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton
           School in <u>1995</u>.
</div></p5>
<br>
<p6><div>
    In 1994, <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy 
    storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic
     ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket 
     Science Games.[41] In <u>1995</u>, he was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)
      program in materials science at Stanford University in California.[42] <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> 
      tried to get a job at Netscape but never received a response to his inquiries.
      [32] He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the 
      Internet boom and launch a startup.
</div></p6>
<h2><b>Business Career</b></h2>
<h3>Zip2</h3>
<p6><div>
In <u>1995</u>, <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span>, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2
with funds borrowed from <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span>'s father.[44][23] They housed the venture at a small
rented office in Palo Alto.[45] The company developed and marketed an Internet city
guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages
.[46] <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> says that before the company became successful, he could not afford an
apartment and instead rented an office; he slept on the couch, showered at the YMCA, 
and shared one computer with his brother.
</div></p6>
<br>
<p7><div>
According to <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span>, "The website was up during the day and I was coding it at night, 
seven days a week, all the time."[45] The <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> brothers obtained contracts with The
New York Times and the Chicago Tribune,[48] and persuaded the board of directors to 
abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.[49] <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span>'s attempts to become <b>ceo</b> were 
thwarted by the board.[50] Compaq acquired Zip2 for <span style=color:green><b>$</b></span>307 million in cash in February
<u>1999</u>,[51][52] and <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> received <span style=color:green><b>$</b></span>22 million for his 7-percent share.
</div>
</p7>

<h3>X.com and Paypal</h3>
<p8><div>
In <u>1999</u>, <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment 
company.[54] The startup was one of the first federally insured online banks, and,
in its initial months of operation, over 200,000 customers joined the service.[55]
The company's investors regarded <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit
<b></b><b>ceo</b> Bill Harris by the end of the year.[56] The following year, X.com merged with 
online bank Confinity to avoid competition.[45][56][57] Founded by Max Levchin and
Peter Thiel,[58] Confinity had its own money-transfer service, PayPal, which was 
more popular than X.com's service.
</div></p8>
<br>
<p9><div>
Within the merged company, <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> returned as <b></b><b>ceo</b>. <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span>'s preference for Microsoft 
software over Unix created a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign.[60]
Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a cohesive business model, the 
board ousted <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[61][b] Under Thiel,
the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in <u>2001</u>.[63][64] 
In <u>2002</u>, PayPal was acquired by eBay for <span style=color:green><b>$</b></span>1.5 billion in stock, of which <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span>â€”the
largest shareholder with 11.72% of sharesâ€”received <span style=color:green><b>$</b></span>175.8 million.[65][66] 
In <u>2017</u>, <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount,
explaining it has sentimental value.
</div></p9>

<h3>SpaceX</h3>
<p10><div>
In early <u>2001</u>, <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed 
funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[69] In October the same
year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished 
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads 
into space. He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> was seen
as a novice[70] and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 
<u>2002</u>, the group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look
for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket
for <span style=color:green><b>$</b></span>8 million, which <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> rejected. He instead decided to start a company that 
could build affordable rockets.[70] With <span style=color:green><b>$</b></span>100 million of his early fortune,[71] 
<span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> founded <span style=color:red><i>SpaceX</i></span> in <u>May 2002 </u> became the company's <b><b>ceo</b></b> and Chief Engineer.
</div></p10>
<br>
<p11><div>
<span style=color:red><i>SpaceX</i></span> attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in <u>2006</u>.[74] Though the 
rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation
 Services program contract from NASA Administrator (and former <span style=color:red><i>SpaceX</i></span> consultant[75]) 
 Mike Griffin later that year.[76][77] After two more failed attempts that nearly 
 caused <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> and his companies to bankrupt,[74] <span style=color:red><i>SpaceX</i></span> succeeded in launching the 
 Falcon 1 into orbit in <u>2008</u>.[78] Later that year, <span style=color:red><i>SpaceX</i></span> received a <span style=color:green><b>$</b></span>1.6 billion 
 Commercial Resupply Services program contract from NASA for 12 flights of its
Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing 
the Space Shuttle after its <u>2011</u> retirement.[79] In <u>2012</u>, the Dragon vehicle berthed
with the ISS, a first for a private enterprise.[80] <span style="color:blue"><b>Musk</b></span> credited the NASA award, 
one of the last actions by Mike Griffin as NASA Administrator, for saving 
the company.
